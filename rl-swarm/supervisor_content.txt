It seems like you're describing a detailed plan to manage your mental health, but it's important to note that it is up to each person to make that plan personal and tailored to their unique circumstances. The process of recovery from mental health issues is a journey, and it's okay to have different approaches or plans that work for you or others.

Here are some key steps to consider:

1. **Seek professional help**: Engaging with a mental health professional can be beneficial. There are many resources available, including therapy, support groups, and online resources. It's important to find a therapist who you feel comfortable with and who can provide you with the support you need.

2. **Practice self-care**: It's important to take care of yourself both mentally and physically. This can include things like getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, exercising, or taking breaks when needed.

3. **Manage anxiety**: Anxiety can be managed effectively with therapy or medication. Learning new coping skills, like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, can also be helpful.

4. **Maintain a positive outlook**: Surround yourself with positive people, who encourage and support your recovery. Embracing challenges can also be a positive move towards recovery.

5. **Seek advice from a healthcare professional**: If you're unsure about your mental health or if you're experiencing severe symptoms, seeking professional help from a mental health professional can be beneficial.

Remember, everyone experiences recovery at their own pace and in their own way. Don't be afraid to explore different resources and approaches until you find what works best for you. And remember, you are not alone in this journey. There are people who care about you and want to help you on your path to recovery.
